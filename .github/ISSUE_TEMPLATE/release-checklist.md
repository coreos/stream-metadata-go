Release checklist:

Tagging:
 - [ ] Write release notes in `docs/release-notes.md`. Get them reviewed and merged
   - [ ] If doing a branched release, also include a PR to merge the `docs/release-notes.md` changes into main
 - [ ] Ensure your local copy is up to date with the upstream main branch (`git@github.com:coreos/stream-metadata-go.git`)
 - [ ] Ensure your working directory is clean (`git clean -fdx`)
 - [ ] Ensure you can sign commits and any yubikeys/smartcards are plugged in
 - [ ] Run `./tag_release.sh <vX.Y.z> <git commit hash>`
 - [ ] Push that tag to GitHub

GitHub release:
 - [ ] Find the new tag in the [GitHub tag list](https://github.com/coreos/stream-metadata-go/tags) and click the triple dots menu, and create a draft release for it.
 - [ ] Copy and paste the release notes from `docs/release-notes.md`
 - [ ] Publish the release
